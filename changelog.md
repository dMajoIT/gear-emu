## Version 15.03.26

* Corrections on all the effects for PASM hub operations (zero, carry and return): CLKSET. COGID, COGINIT, COGSTOP, LOCKNEW, LOCKRET, LOCKSET, LOCKCLR. There was some missing values for carry & zero flags.

* Algorithm optimization for PropellerCPU.PinChanged() to determinate the pin state faster for DIR and OUT.

* Corrected reset events invocations, affecting pins & lock state, and logic view. Now all of them are reset effectively.

* Improvements on LogicView, to show more helpful messages on errors, labels on buttons and text boxes.

* In Plugin Editor now you can start with a default plugin template (new default) or empty window (old default style). The program recovers it from "Resource\PluginTemplate.cs.

* Updated PluginBase class structure, so all the old plugins have to be updated:
    -Constructor invocation must call Base constructor.
    -Extra parameter on OnClock() method for current clock number in tick clocks.
    -Method PresentChip() with no param, beacuse Chip reference now is included in plugin base class definition.
    -New method OnClose() is called for every plugin before closing the emulator (to perform cleanup).

* Added program settings to remember them between sessions (stored in "Gear.exe.config" file in this version):
    -TimeFrame and TickMarkGrid on logic view.
    -LastBinary & LastPlugin on Emulator, GearDesktop & PluginEditor.
    -UpdateEachSteps to enable changes on the screen refresh rate.
    -Added "UseNoTemplate" program setting to enable load plugin editor empty (old default style).

* Changed names and tooltips on buttons "open plugin", "load plugin", "open binary" on GearDesktop & Emulator.

* Memory leaks prevention: Corrections for Disposable members in CogView, LogicView, MemoryView & PluginEditor.

* Improved general documentation of source code, including specific pages for sequence of callings for PropellerCPU.Step() and loading a plugin in memory after compilation.


## Version 14.07.03

* Faster emulation.
    - In my own testing, GEAR runs now about 30% or 35% faster than Gear V09_10_26, maybe because the executable now use MS .NET framework 4.0 instead of 2.0. The drawback is the need to download the framework, but in windows 7 or 8, probably it is installed already.
    - Also, updated the project files to MS Visual C# 2010 Express (the old proyect was in MS Visual C# 2005). I use that because it was the only I could find.

* Show Cog RAM Special Purpose Registers values.
    - Now the values of special registers in cog memory (between $1F0 - PAR and $1FF - VSCL) are displayed correctly in memory or PASM view.

* Logic modes in counters.
    - Logic modes (CTRMODE between %10000 and %11111) didn't work well in past versions of Gear.

* Correction to enable PAR register changes.
    - As there was some reports of prop forum users that GEAR was of not capable to change the PAR cog register (forum thread ["PASM simulator / debugger?"](https://forums.parallax.com/discussion/115909/PASM-simulator-debugger)) then I enabled it. They claims that some parallax video drivers in PASM changes the PAR register, and GEAR didn't emulate that. The Propeller Manual V1.2 specify that is a read-only register, but if parallax did that drivers that really run on the real one...

* Fixes in Logic View.
    - When you reload a binary or reset it, and you had run it before using pins, the logic view show a mix between new and old samples.
    - If you are using windows in other languages than english, -with other number formats-, the preset values for time frame and tick mark (with "." decimal separator) will not work if you press the update button.

* Flickering correction on cog view over PASM lines.
    - When you were on cog view (PASM code), the tool tip text sometimes flickers.

* Tooltips over pins and locks in hub view.
    - Added tooltips on hub view on pins and locks views (IN*, DIR*, Floating, Lock Free, Locks), to identify easily which pin or lock is.

* Plugin editor enhancements.
    - Experimental C# sintax highlighting of code. Now the name of the file is displayed on the title of the window. Added tooltips to be more self explaining.


## Version 09.10.26 26 October 2009

* Many thanks to Bob Anderson for identifying bugs in and subsequently testing improvements to the emulation of SUBS, SUBSX, CMPSX and REV.


## Version 09.06.05 (140) 5 June 2009

* Many thanks to Ben Levitt for improving the behaviour of GEAR. (Reload Binary, Open to PlugIn, Close PlugIn)
* Improvements in SerialIO plugin (Ben Levitt).


## Version 09.05.12 (50) 11 May 2009

* Fixed memory references of the form `LONG[ &MyVar ][ 2 ]`, this case was being emulated as `LONG[ 2 ][ &MyVar ]`.
* Included SerialIO plugin (with thanks to Ben Levitt) in the distribution.


## Version 08.10.16 (151) 16 October 2008

* An extra function has been added which allows hot keys to be disabled for a plugin.
Simply add the following function to your plugin:
`public override Boolean AllowHotKeys { get { return false; } }`


## Version 08.04.29 (159) 29 April 2008
* The lastest stimulus.zip is now included in V08_04_29.zip.
* 'R' and 'S' keys can now be used to run, stop and step the currently active cog.
* Floating the cursor over an assembly cog page shows the values stored at the source and destination registers for the instruction line that's under the mouse. The values are shown as both hex and decimal.

### On 23 January 2008

* Updated stimulus.zip. Still works with V08_01_18 of GEAR.
* The stimulus plug-in page has a context menu which allows a new stimulus file to be loaded and the current one to be saved.
* Editing of the stimulus file is allowed - previously it was read-only.
* As part of the stimulus file, it is now possible to include the words reset and stop.

reset - simulates a reset of the processor.
stop - causes a breakpoint - click Run to go to the next stop / breakpoint

### On 21 January 2008

* Added stimulus.zip which updates stimulus.xml and the example stimulus file. It is now possible to do clock and pwm generation.

## Version (1.5.0.0)

* Proper handling of condition field on native instructions
* VSCL is now buffered between WAITVID frames (VCFG is not)
* Changed behavior of Forward and Reverse random (negitive feedback LSFR, rather than rotating buffer with XOR)
