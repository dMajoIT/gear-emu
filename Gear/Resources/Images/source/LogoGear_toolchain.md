# Toolchain to build the Logo of Gear Emulator
![Logo Gear](../LogoGear-64.png)

1. Color disk: Open `PropellerColorDisk.svg` in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), at least 1.1 version. Export PNG Image of page, to a 800x800 px PNG, with name `PropellerColorDisk.png`.
 
2. Main design of gear shape: open `LogoGear.FCStd` in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/), at least 0.19 version. Also it needs to have installed [POV-Ray-Rendering_Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/POV-Ray-Rendering_Workbench) plugin.
 
    It contains the 3D objects of the design, based on original geometry from Gear `RingMeter.cs`. There are solids for:
    - GearBody: shape with 8 teeths, extruded from 2D to 3D, and modified to rounded borders.
    - Marker: triangle hollow shape.
    - MarkerInternal: the inside of marker, to enable to use a different texture/color.
    - Numbers
    - PropellerColorDisk: imported `png` image generated from `svg` file.

3. Export to POV-Ray renderer: from FreeCAD select POV-Ray-Rendering workbench. It would export the scene to `LogoGear.pov`, with modified geometries.

   To preserve from inadverted changes, the final POV-Ray scene saved to GitHub is named `LogoGear-final.pov`. Copy the changes from new generated files, to final ones.

|File exported from FreeCAD|Destination of exported|Final file|Destination of final|Description|
|:------------------------:|:---------:|:--------:|----------:|-----------|
|`LogoGear.pov`|Delete|`LogoGear-final.pov`|Persistent|Main scene definition file|
|`LogoGear.ini`|Delete|`LogoGear-final.ini`|Persistent|Settings to render files|
|`LogoGear_meshes.inc`|Delete|`LogoGear_meshes-final.inc`|Persistent|Mesh definitions of each object|
|`LogoGear_textures.inc`|Delete|`LogoGear_textures-final.inc`|Persistent|Texture of each object|
|`LogoGear_user.inc`|Delete|-|Not used|Additional user objects, generated by Workbench|
|`LogoGear_FatalError.out`|Delete|-|Not used|Temp file for Workbench|

4. Render in POV-Ray: Using [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/) version 3.7 or newer, open `LogoGear-final.pov`, with `LogoGear-final.ini` ini-file, to render the logo images to desired sizes.
